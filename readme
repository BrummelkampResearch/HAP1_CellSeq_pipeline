Brief overview:
------------------
taqcount.sh is a bash script to process the Illumia sequencing data from fixed haploid screens. The input 
for the program are the two fastq files, either decompressed or gzipped. The final result is a tab separated tables
files containing the number of unique mutations in every gene and for both samples. A fisher exact test is used to compare
the numbers and significance between the two samples. The file can be imported into Prism or other visualization software
for plotting the fixed screen graph.

Dependencies:
------------------
- perl5
- bowtie (tested on v0.12.7 64-bit)
- intersectBed (tested on v2.11.1)
- R
- pigz (not required but allows for faster compression of intermediate files by using multiple cores, compared to gzip)




- Changed command line arguments
	-L=|--low=, -H=|--high=, -N=|--screenname=, -C=|--compress, -h|-?|--help, -U|--uncompressed
- Changed compress_output.sh
	- Added ability to compress using pigz
	- Extended the list of filenames to be compressed (if the input fastq was already gzipped, the output filenames also contain a .gz and these did get zipped)
	- Changed some intermediate printf comments to make the pipeline more logic and comments that results can be viewed while still working on compression
- Changed compression if-statements created on 24th and added a help section
	#########################
	# In compress only mode, solely old results are compressed and theres no need to continue execution of the script
	# Same for --help of course
	if [[ $COMPRESS =~ "/" ]]
   	     then
        	        bash sub/compress_output.sh $COMPRESS # Script to compress output files
               	 exit
	fi
	if [[ $HELP == "yes" ]]
       		then
                	cat sub/help
                	exit
	fi
	########################

	########################
	if [[ $COMPRESS != "NO" ]]
        	then
                	printf "\n Analysis completed. Feel free to peek in the results files while I'll keep working on compressing the intermediate files for a little longer.\n"
  	              	pwd=$(pwd)
        	        out_dir="$pwd/$OUT/"
     	           	bash sub/compress_output.sh $out_dir
   		else
        	        printf "\nSkipping compression of intermediate files"
	fi

25/8/2015
- Found a bug: if the GeneRef file contains a string of hashes, the R-script makes an error on calling the right collumns. Make sure there are no
  hashes in the GeneRef file.
- Changed the following line in sub/GeneRef_hg19_uniq-s_last_try_delim_cat_final.bed
	chrX	49188093	49313710	GAGE-LOCUS	0	+
	(GAGE-LOCUS used to be ####.....#####)
- Created a help file that can be accessed by ./tagCount --help or -h or -?

24/8/2015
- Added the ability to compress output files
- Added 2 if statements to taqcount.sh
	- 	First statement allows for compressing the data of an already performed run by running the
		script ./taqcount.sh -cr /full/path/to/output_folder (-compout stands for compress output)
		************
		if [[ $0 == "-compout" ]]
		then
			bash sub/compress_output.sh $2 # Script to compress output files
			exit
		fi
		************

	-	Second statement allows for automatic compression of output results
		************
		if [[ $4 == "-cr" ]]
		then
			prinf "\n Compressing intermediate output files...\n"
			sub/compress_output.sh $3
		fi
		************
- Created addition bash script to compress file
	sub/compress_output.sh
